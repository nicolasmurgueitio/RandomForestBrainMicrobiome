# RandomForest Brain Microbiome

Notes Microbiome Brain-Emotional Learning Analyses BEE Study:
1)	Only included rows with full data for both taxonomic and structural imaging data
   
   Data comes from  2 week-old infants 
   
   n=88
   
2)	Used  genus-level scaled cell counts (x/10000) processed using Bayesian Reestimation of Abundance with KrakEN:
  Whole Genome Shotgun Sequencing with spike-in
  
3)	Looking at 4 different structural neural volumes related to emotional learning: amygdala, hippocampus, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)
