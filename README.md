   Data comes from  2 week-old infants 
   n=86 with full data
3)	Used the genus-level normed data (/10000) processed by the microbiome core processed with Bracken 
  Whole Genome Shotgun Sequencing with spike-in
5)	Looking at 4 different structural volumes: bilateral: amygdala, hippocampus, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)
