Notes for Random Forest Regressions Microbiome/Brain BEE

Only using participants with full data (n=88), no missing data across data frames. 

Structural volumes:
-Bilateral amygdala-> sum of left and right amygdala
-Bilateral hippocampus-> sum of left and right hippocampus
-Bilateral insula-> sum of of left and right amygdala

Taxonomic data:
-Genus level-> absolute abundances

Data preparation:
-Did not remove taxa with many zeros (eg >20% zeros)
-# of taxa = 1858

Insula notes:
-RF had good fit (r2)
-Model was significant after permutation (1000) test
-After removing top10 features model no longer had good fit (Veillonella, Enterococcus, Finegoldia, Pseudomonas, Peptacetobacter, Flavobacterium, Acinetobacter, Massilistercora, Lacticaseibacillus, Shewanella)

Amygdala notes:
-RF did not have good fit (r2)

Hippocampus notes:
-RF did not have good fit (r2)
